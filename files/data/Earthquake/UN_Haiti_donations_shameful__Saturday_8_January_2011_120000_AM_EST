GENEVA: A United Nations spokeswoman has criticised the response to an appeal to counter the deadly cholera epidemic in Haiti as ''shameful'' after the world body received only a quarter of the funding it needs.

''Out of the $US174 million, the UN has only received $US44 million, or 25 per cent of the funds we asked for, although [the situation] is of the utmost urgency,'' the spokeswoman for the UN Organisation for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Elisabeth Byrs, said.

''It's not moving. It's shameful that we should have so little money for an illness that kills in a flash because people don't have rehydration salts,'' she said.

Cholera can swiftly dehydrate patients without treatment for potentially deadly cases of diarrhoea. The disease has killed 3333 people and infected 150,000 since it appeared in the earthquake-hit Caribbean nation last October, according to figures provided by Haiti's health ministry last week.

The Pan American Health Organisation warned in November that up to 400,000 people could contract cholera in a year. Last month the UN had received just 20 per cent of the funds.

In November the OCHA asked donors for extra money to treat cholera as health workers rushed to halt the rapid spread of the disease, nine months after a devastating earthquake killed 250,000 people and displaced 1.9 million. Wednesday will be the first anniversary of the disaster.

Ms Byrs said that cholera could easily be treated when patients received appropriate care. The funding would also help to prevent contamination of waterways and set up more treatment centres in rural areas.

By last month, donors had provided just over $US1 billion of the $US1.5 billion the UN asked for in its earlier appeal for quake relief and reconstruction.

This year the world body will seek an additional $US906 million to help Haiti, including money to deal with cholera.
