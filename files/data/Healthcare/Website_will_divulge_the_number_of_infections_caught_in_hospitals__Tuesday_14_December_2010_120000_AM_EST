THE rate of infections caught by hospital patients will be published on the My Hospitals website as part of the planned release of more sensitive information.

The Health Minister, Nicola Roxon, has told the Herald that the waiting-time information published nationally on the new My Hospitals website last Friday was ''just the beginning''.

''We are working with the states and territories to expand the website to include a wide range of hospital data that we know consumers are after, including safety and quality data such as infection rates,'' Ms Roxon said.

However, she would not say whether the expansion would include details on waiting times for outpatient services such as chemotherapy.

Public hospitals and consumer groups say that while the My Hospitals site is a welcome start, there is much more information realistically available which should be published.

Prue Power, the executive director of the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, representing public hospitals, said that information about patient safety was more important than waiting times.

Besides infection rates in hospitals, there were several other significant indicators of hospital performance that should be published, Ms Power said.

The Consumer Health Forum director, Carol Bennett, said the website was a welcome platform but should be able to publish more information on areas such as outpatient waiting times.

''That is something we would certainly like to see and it should not be be too difficult [to provide],'' Ms Bennett said. ''Most hospitals would have the data on different types of services.''
