Signs that the retail and housing markets are improving encouraged traders to extend a stock rally into a second day on Thursday.

Major retailers reported sales in November that were stronger than analysts expected. Increased spending during the holiday season would be a strong signal that consumers are feeling more confident.

Costco Wholesale Corp, Target Corp and Limited Brands Inc all beat Wall Street sales forecasts. Teen retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co jumped 10.5 per cent after reporting that its sales soared 32 per cent.

The National Association of Realtors said the number of people who signed contracts to buy homes jumped 10.4 per cent in October. Economists expected a slight decline. Home builders KB Home and Toll Brothers Co each rose by more than three per cent.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.59, or 0.82 per cent, to 11,348.37. The Dow jumped 2.3 per cent on Wednesday, its biggest gain since Sept 1, after a report showed that private employers were adding jobs.

The Standard and Poor's 500 index rose 12.68, or 1.05 per cent, to 1,218.75. The Nasdaq composite index rose 23.23, or 0.91 per cent, to 2,572.66.

The strong economic reports overshadowed an unexpected rise in new claims for unemployment benefits. The Labor Department said first-time unemployment claims rose to 436,000 last week.

Traders found a silver lining in the report, however: the average number of new unemployment claims over the past month fell to a two-year low, signaling that the job market may be improving.

LONDON - The euro and European stocks were sharply higher on Thursday as surprisingly strong US home sales offset disappointment at a lack of fresh stimulus action from the European Central Bank.

Dealers said the markets were firmer in early trade after a solid showing in Asia amid speculation the ECB might announce radical new measures, but they slipped back when the bank largely kept policy steady.

In late trade, however, they moved ahead strongly after better-than-expected US pending home sales in October offered hope the housing market might finally be stabilising and confirmed recent signs the economy might be picking up again.

In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares jumped 2.22 per cent to finish at 5,767.56 points. In Paris, the CAC 40 gained 2.12 per cent to 3,747.04 points while in Frankfurt the DAX rose 1.32 per cent to 6,957.61 points.

The euro was also much firmer, rising to 1.3231 dollars in late trade from 1.3138 dollars in New York late Wednesday.

The euro and stock markets were helped by a general easing of tensions on the eurozone money markets, especially in Spain, Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Italy, those countries seen most at risk of debt and deficit contagion.

Irish 10-year bond yields - the rate of return earned by the holder - fell very sharply to 8.297 per cent from 8.654 per cent on Wednesday, with Spain's 10-year bond down to 5.004 per cent from 5.254 per cent.

Among other European stock markets, Amsterdam rose 1.68 per cent, Brussels added 2.00 per cent, Madrid jumped 2.78 per cent, Milan put on 2.49 per cent and Swiss stocks gained 1.15 per cent.

TOKYO - Japanese shares gained 1.81 per cent on Thursday supported by rallies in the US and European markets and a relatively weaker yen, dealers said.

The headline Nikkei index at the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained 180.47 points to close at 10,168.52. The Topix index of all first section shares rose 1.29 per cent or 11.14 points to 877.21.

HONG KONG - Hong Kong shares rose 0.86 per cent as dealers welcomed strong jobs and manufacturing data from the US.

Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index added 198.98 points to close at 23,448.78 on turnover of $HK93.03 billion ($A12.38 billion).

Chinese shares closed up 0.71 per cent as resource stocks tracked gains on Wall Street and concerns eased over the potential for further monetary tightening moves, dealers said.

The Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A and B shares, was up 20.16 points at 2843.61 on turnover of 104.2 billion yuan ($A16.23 billion).

In other markets, Singapore gained 0.50 per cent, Taipei rose 0.77 per cent, Jakarta rose 2.09 per cent, Kuala Lumpur gained 1.20 per cent, Manila surged 3.65 per cent, Bangkok rose 1.41 per cent, and Mumbai rose 0.72 per cent.

India's food inflation index rate fell to its lowest level in 18 months, at 8.6 per cent for the week ended November 20, thanks to adequate monsoon rains.

WELLINGTON - The New Zealand market rose 0.62 per cent, or 20.39 points, to 3,285.49.

Telecom added 1.4 per cent to 2.18 New Zealand dollars and construction company Fletcher Building ended up 0.5 per cent at 7.91 while Fisher & Paykel Healthcare was 2.7 up at 3.07.
