Transocean, the firm that owns the BP-leased offshore rig behind the huge Gulf of Mexico oil spill, on Wednesday accused the British energy giant of having designed a "fatally flawed" well.

"This is a self-serving report that attempts to conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo incident: BP's fatally flawed well design," said Transocean in a statement after BP issued an analysis of the disaster.

"In both its design and construction, BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk - in some cases, severely," said the Swiss-based group.

Transocean's reaction came after BP published a report which found that "a sequence of failures involving a number of different parties led to the explosion and fire".

BP blamed Transocean and another company, Halliburton, which had cemented the well.

But Transocean said the decisions on the construction and design of the rig were "made exclusively by BP".

The oil rig explosion in late April killed 11 people and caused the worst ever US environmental disaster.

BP has already spent $US8 billion ($A8.79 billion) trying to contain the leak and has forecast that it will eventually cost the group more than $US32.2 billion after clean-up costs and compensation are taken into account.
