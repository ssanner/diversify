LOS ANGELES: The artist Shepard Fairey and the Associated Press have confirmed they are settling out of court their legal case that involves Fairey's ''Hope'' poster depicting then-Senator Barack Obama.

But a lawyer for AP said the news organisation is still pursuing its case against Obey Clothing, in which Fairey is a partner, that has reproduced the image on clothing.

Fairey's poster of Mr Obama was inspired by a photograph taken by an AP freelancer in 2006. AP subsequently accused the Los Angeles artist of copyright infringement, with Fairey maintaining that it falls under fair-use laws.

A settlement means the March trial between Fairey and AP in New York will not take place. As part of their settlement, Fairey has agreed he will not use another AP photo in his work without obtaining a licence.

The two sides have also agreed to share the rights to make the posters and merchandise bearing the ''Hope'' image. In addition, Fairey and AP have agreed to additional financial terms that are confidential.

''I am pleased to have resolved the dispute with the Associated Press,'' Fairey said in a statement. ''I respect the work of photographers, as well as recognise the need to preserve opportunities for other artists to make fair use of photographic images.

''I often collaborate with photographers in my work, and I look forward to working with photos provided by the AP's talented photographers.''

AP's case against Obey Clothing has not been resolved, according to a lawyer for AP.
