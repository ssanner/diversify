Emergency volunteers are hoping to reach thousands of residents who have been isolated by flooding on the NSW north coast.

State Emergency Services (SES) workers will assess the situation along the Clarence River on Sunday and are hoping to reach residents by Monday.

Around 7000 people around the state remain cut off from storms that battered the state's north and floodwaters that have flowed downstream from the Queensland floods.

About 6000 of those isolated are residents of the downstream towns of Yamba, Iluka and Maclean.

The SES is sending in essential supplies including bread and milk by air and no properties have been seriously damaged by the flooding, SES spokesman Dave Webber said.

At Boggabilla, near the Queensland border, volunteers are hoping to reach the cut-off town on Sunday or Monday following assessments.

Most of the 650 residents evacuated the town before the Macintyre River peaked at 12.6 metres at midday (AEDT) on Friday.

Further west, 36 residents of the village of New Angledool became isolated on Saturday where the Narran River is expected to peak at 3.1 metres later in the week.

In far west NSW, the 350 residents of Goodooga are isolated and expected to remain that way for another 4 to 8 weeks.

The SES will continue to resupply the town by helicopter and is monitoring downstream communities including Bourke, Louth, Tilpa, Wilcannia and Menindee.

Sixty-three local government areas in NSW have been declared natural disaster areas since December as a result of flooding.
