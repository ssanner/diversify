THE clean-up has begun in northern NSW despite some towns remaining all but cut off by flooding and beachside Yamba still completely isolated late yesterday.

Rescue authorities estimated 6000 people remained stranded in north coast towns, with the swollen Clarence River cutting access to residents in Iluka and Maclean.

''We're still resupplying them by floodboat,'' State Emergency Service spokesman Phil Campbell said yesterday.

''We can get high clearance four-wheel-drives in now but it's still not safe for members of the public to use some of the back roads in the Clarence Valley.''

The service estimates the isolation will continue until midweek.

NSW Premier Kristina Keneally has asked Prime Minister Julia Gillard to make flood relief the first item at next month's Council of Australian Governments summit.

Yesterday Ms Gillard promised one-off disaster relief payments of $1000 per adult and $400 per child in northern NSW.

Clarence MP Steve Cansdell said most towns in the area, including Yamba, should be accessible in some form by last night. ''We've got strong communities here like they do in Queensland and everyone's willing to pitch in and help the clean-up,'' Mr Cansdell said.

About 30 people remained in Boggabilla, near the Queensland border, but were reportedly safe on high ground.

About 650 residents were evacuated before the Macintyre River peaked at 12.6 metres on Friday. In Goondiwindi, on the Queensland side of the border, the Macintyre peaked at 10.55 metres, below the town's 11-metre levees.

Mayor Graeme Scheu said farmers would suffer huge losses.

Sixty-three local government areas in NSW have been declared natural disaster areas since December.

Although the situation is expected to improve, fears remain that any cyclones reaching Queensland could cause more floods south of the border.
