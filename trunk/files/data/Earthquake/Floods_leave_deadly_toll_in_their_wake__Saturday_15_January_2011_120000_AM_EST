RESCUE workers in Brazil were battling to reach areas cut off by landslides that have killed more than 500 people, as rain and floods continued to devastate Sri Lanka and the Philippines.

Torrents of mud and water that followed heavy rains cut a destructive path through the mountainous Serrana region near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, toppling houses, buckling roads and burying families.

''It's like an earthquake struck some areas,'' said Jorge Mario, the mayor of the Brazilian mountain-top town of Teresopolis, where at least 158 people died in a mudslide.

Fernando Rodrigues, a bar owner, said: ''It was terrifying. There were cars flying everywhere. It was dark. People were screaming.''

The total number of deaths due to the weather in southern Brazil is at least 388, including 13 who died in Sao Paulo state this week.

In eastern Sri Lanka, days of heavy rain have caused floods and mudslides leaving more than 1 million people homeless. So far, 23 people have died, but doctors are bracing themselves for outbreaks of typhoid and diarrhoea as water supplies become contaminated.

A spokesman for the disaster management centre in the capital, Colombo, said that the district of Batticaloa, which saw heavy fighting in the civil war that ended in 2009, was badly affected after heavier-than-usual seasonal rains.

''Some 533,000 people have been displaced in Batticaloa district alone, where we have set up 225 camps to accommodate them,'' he said.

In central and southern parts of the Philippines rain, floods and landslides have killed 42 and displaced nearly 400,000.

Damage to crops and infrastructure is estimated at more than 1 billion pesos ($22.7 million).

The Australian and Philippine floods have been linked to the La Nina weather pattern, which causes Pacific sea temperatures to cool, bringing more rainfall in the western Pacific, and less in the east.
