QUEENSLAND flood victims have already lodged more than 4500 claims worth $150  million but insurance records are likely to remain intact.

It will take another $3.8 billion worth of claims to top those of the  Newcastle earthquake of 1989, the Insurance Council of Australia said.

Spokeswoman Sandra van Dijk said many victims of the floods could have to  wait weeks to lodge their claims, ''so it is going to be a long [insurance]  event''.

The hail storms in Melbourne last March lasted only one hour and resulted in  $500 million worth of claims. Last year's Queensland floods resulted in 5500  claims worth $100 million.

''[In Melbourne], people got their claims in immediately, [whereas] in this  situation a lot of policy holders have to wait until the water recedes to get in  the assessors,'' she said.

Ms van Dijk said many insurers now offered automatic flood cover.
