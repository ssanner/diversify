Civil engineering consultant Cardno Ltd has flagged a jump in first half profit following a strong contribution from acquisitions.

However, the company  says the second half won't be as strong because of the stronger Australian dollar and lower levels of activity in the Gulf of Mexico.

Shares in Cardno were up 34 cents, or 7.71 per cent, at $4.75 at 1517 AEDT.

The company said it expected a net profit of between $29 million and $31 million for the six months ending December 31, an increase of between 81 per cent and 93 per cent compared to the previous corresponding period.

Managing director Andrew Buckley said the increase in earnings was the result of a strong contribution from acquisitions made in the 2009/10 financial year.

Mr Buckley flagged further future acquisitions in North America and Australia.

The improved profit was due also to a return to organic growth generated through the integration of new partners and a focus on cross-selling across the business, Mr Buckley said.

He said the company's second half performance was expected to be robust but not as strong as the first half due to the stronger Australian dollar and lower levels of activity in the Gulf of Mexico where Cardno has been undertaking environmental protection work on the BP oil spill.

"The Gulf of Mexico oil spill is now moving from an emergency response phase to an ongoing assessment operation," Mr Buckley said.

"However, market conditions across the rest of the business continue to improve."
