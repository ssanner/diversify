LONDON: BP's damages bill for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill could be smaller than expected after it was revealed that half the claims made so far to the $US20 billion compensation fund either have no supporting documents or ''woefully inadequate'' ones.

Ken Feinberg, appointed by the White House to run the claims process, said BP would be able to automatically challenge any individual claim of more than $US500,000.

Although BP has set aside $US20 billion to pay all ''legitimate claims'' from the biggest accidental offshore oil spill, privately it thinks its final compensation bill will be significantly lower.

Tuesday was the deadline for emergency claims covering the past six months. The fund will now start accepting final lump-sum claims, which require recipients to waive the right to sue BP.

Mr Feinberg said he would make $US2.3 billion in emergency payments to about 175,000 claimants. Before he took over the process from BP in late August, the company had paid out less than $US400 million in four months.

The fund has received 450,000 claims in the past three months. Many of these are from fishermen or others involved in the fishing industry, which was banned from operating in large parts of the Gulf before the well was capped.

But Mr Feinberg said 125,000 of the claims were submitted with no accompanying documents, such as tax receipts to show proof of earnings. A further 100,000 were submitted with ''woefully inadequate'' documents, and 1000 suspected fraudulent claims had been referred to the Department of Justice.

Many fishermen and oyster catchers in the Gulf are Vietnamese, many of whom speak no English and do not keep records of income or pay tax, typically selling their catch for cash. They are unlikely to receive anything, Mr Feinberg has indicated, even if their claims are legitimate.
