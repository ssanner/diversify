The Australian share market closed lower on Friday, after big market contributors in the resources and banking sectors ended weaker.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index ended down 20.9 points, or 0.44 per cent, at 4,763.1 points, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 15.8 points, or 0.32 per cent, to 4,853.0 points.

On the ASX 24, the March share price index futures contract was down 23 points at 4,759 points, on volume of 21,075 contracts.

Stocks opened marginally weaker after a mixed lead from the offshore session, when Wall Street closed firmer, but commodities prices eased, and stayed in red figures for the rest of the day.

Austock Securities senior client adviser Michael Heffernan said the positive performance of stocks in the healthcare and information technology sectors helped minimise the broad-market decline.

"It is the defensives that have ruled the roost today, no question at all about that," Mr Heffernan said.

"I suppose when you have got major banks and the major resources going down, it is going to be the defensives that are going to win out in the end and that's the way it has been today."

The healthcare sector gained 0.65 per cent, telecoms finished 0.74 per cent higher and discretionary stocks ended 0.54 per cent firmer, according to Iress data.

Mining giant BHP Billiton fell 35 cents to $45.03, while rival Rio Tinto was down $1.35, or 1.55 per cent, at $85.65.

Meanwhile, financial stocks ended in mostly negative territory.

ANZ closed down 17 cents at $23.59, Commonwealth Bank slipped 24 cents to $50.70 and National Australia Bank backpedalled 29 cents to $24.15.

ANZ chairman John Morschel told shareholders at the bank's annual general meeting there was "potential vulnerability" the bank's funding costs as Europe and US worked through public debt and other issues resulting from the global financial crisis.

Westpac climbed four cents to $23.19.

In other news, Santos announced a $500 million capital raising and said it had sold a 7.5 per cent stake in the Gladstone liquefied natural gas project to Korean Gas Corp and another 7.5 per cent to French company Total for a combined $665 million.

The company was in a trading halt and last traded at $12.97.

The spot price of gold in Sydney finished at $US1,375.40 per fine ounce, down $US6.425 from Thursday's closing price of $US1,381.825.

Newcrest Mining ended 69 cents lower at $40.77.

Elsewhere, the NSW Court of Appeal lifted bans on seven former James Hardie directors, overturning a NSW Supreme Court ruling that they broke the law by claiming a new trust set up for asbestos victims in 2001 was "fully funded".

In a separate decision, James Hardie lost its appeal against a finding that it had breached the Corporations Act.

James Hardie finished down nine cents, or 1.33 per cent, at $6.68.

Mr Heffernan said the market was "not all that fussed" by the court's decision.

"James Hardie has been in the wars for years now, so unless there is something drastic one way or another, it is not really going to shift too much," he said.

The most traded stock by volume was Westfield Retail Trust, with 68.93 million securities changing hands for $184.21 million.

The company finished six cents higher at $2.69.

National turnover was 2.63 billion securities worth $5.20 billion, with 593 stocks up, 520 down and 391 unchanged.
