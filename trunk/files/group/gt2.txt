Several ways of measuring the value of research - publications, general interest, applications with a definable benefit. However, in my opinion, the BEST way of measuring the value of research is not what it solves, but the number of new questions it opens up for further research

Research can be measured in a number of ways, both short-term and long-term. Short-tem measurements include number of publications, direct funding grants for that research, patents granted and patents licensed, or external auditing. Long-term research is probably best measure in terms of influence, that is the number of citations that work has received after five or ten years (also residual long-term technology and patent licensing).

Basic and applied research (and the many shades between) require different measurements since basic research tends to have a longer time before it has impact whereas applied research has more immediate results.

I would tend to believe more strongly in long-term measurements than short-term measurements, but funding agencies of course must rely on short-term measurements except when funding people, who have an established track record.

Depends on industry and comparing timelines of similar problems. Is there a tangible outcome or product from the research. Will development continue when the research is completed.

The value of a research depends on who is measuring it. For universities, it will depend on the amount of citations it receives and publication rankings

Client-based research produces limited outcomes.

Submitted by 20 (2011-03-24 22:21:24)
2.3	
Yes it's possible. A client may come in with preconeived ideas and could expect a certain outcome.

clients dont always know what questions to ask

A client usually desires a specific outcome and may not be happy if a researcher wants to try something else

Unconstrained research may not produce outcomes as often as client based research, but is usually more innovative and so should be encouraged

No, client-based research produces accurate point solutions. Usually these solutions can be generalised to other tasks too. And outcomes are reliable proofs of concept. Plus often we get general research questions elated to basic research. Usually client-based research progresses also faster and from there feeds general non-client based research.

Ideally, there would be a "portfolio" of outcomes including immediate, low-risk, low-impact and long-term, high-risk, high impact.

However, there is the caveat that client-based research is fully focused on the details of an implementation and yields (a) no publishable research results, and (b) at the end of the day, the tool produced is not useful and gets forgotten.
Submitted by 5 (2011-03-24 22:24:10)

Client based research may not allow time for other research, but can lead to questions being thought of that may be studied later - maybe there is a balance of splitting time between client based and other research?
Submitted by 9 (2011-03-24 22:24:22)

Client based research will still produce less limited outcomes than not doing research at all

The client may have an agenda that leads to the researcher providing information and recommendations that lead to limited outcomes.

With client-based research there might be a need to limit research to a very narrow/limited scope --> then the outcomes may be limited too nd generalising the outcomes may belong to future work.
Submitted by 2 (2011-03-24 22:25:32)

Maybe limited or constrained outcomes may be good: perhaps you want it to fit a particular
small set of areas

Clients often have diffuiculty understanding the processes that are invovlved or available to conduct research
Submitted by 14 (2011-03-24 22:26:35)

client-based research may not be of the highest quality as they may want the outcome to be confidential and hence will not lead to publications which most researchers see as a success.

client based research has measurable value, blue sky could *potentially* have derived value
Submitted by 18 (2011-03-24 22:27:43)
2.31	
Client based outcomes may have short turn around times for delivery. This could limit the quality of the task at hand as well as limit the scope of doing extra research above and beyond the client's original request.

Research and Development conducted by industry is better at producing tangible outputs, than academia.

I have never worked in industry, so I cannot comment on what industry is good/not good at producing
Submitted by 9 (2011-03-24 22:33:01)

Industry does contribute a tangible than academia, but industry cannot product fundamental result, which cannot be measure in the short terms.

If the keyword here is tangibility, then yes certainly, this is the focus of industrial research and not the focus of all academic research.

There is a strong tendency for industrial R&D to make their objective to produce tangible outputs.

Industry may hold more experience professional who are working the field who can apply their knowledge more so than academia

3.9	
using both options would produce a better outcome...
Submitted by 21 (2011-03-24 22:34:46)
3.10	
Correct. In industry, there is just one objective to optimise: income. In academia, outputs cover many aspects: teaching/training, research, grants, commercialisation, publications... Hence, the outputs of academia are perhaps not so tangible. However, it depends what is tangible.
Submitted by 2 (2011-03-24 22:34:48)
3.11	
R&D is motivated by commercialization, academic is motivated by publication, so R&D will produce more tangible research results.
Submitted by 5 (2011-03-24 22:35:05)
3.12	
very true as industry is dollar driven and focus more on the market which requires tangible products. competition also makes industry a lot more competitive and therefore always try to produce tangible outcomes
Submitted by 19 (2011-03-24 22:35:28)
3.13	
Industry focusses on profit and reseach has to address the bottom line. Industries that do fund basic research have so much money they dont know what to do with it so they can invest in an altruistic objective.
Submitted by 14 (2011-03-24 22:35:48)
3.14	
Industry produces solutions that work. Academia also tests/develops ideas that may not work and are hence less tangible now (but are perhaps more tangible in the future).
Submitted by 2 (2011-03-24 22:35:56)

If R&D value is measured by the quality of product and ease of use by the wider population, the answer is yes.

people in academia have 'pet projects' which may not produce an output for a long time. Industry may need to justify their projects more?
Submitted by 9 (2011-03-24 22:36:10)

Due to pure research objectives, academic R&D can produce better and more reusable code, hence sometimes better than the very focused results produced by industry.

May vary. Academia may produce less biased research. Industry may be closer to the area of research. Industry may be prepared to conduct only the typr of research which would be financially beneficial to them. Academic research may be conditioned by available funding. Industry may deliver the research product faster because of the opportunities to be gained from the outcomes of the research. It is possible that each caters for a different sector of the research market.

R&D in industry is usually performed to a limited budget with a low priority. Paying work takes precedence. Academia may have more opportunity to do research.

Industry may produce biased outputs, biased towards their commercial perspective, e.g., drug research.

3.25	
Industry is focused on value. However, value does not necessarily equate to "money". Can also include targets such as brand, reputation, confidence, even goodwill. Academia is not necessarily as targeted, and may do research purely for the research (though in the real case, may also be motivated by money, status, etc as well)

Could industry research be used to reinforce the message that a business enterprise wants to promote? For example, many years ago, tobacco companies used to claim that their research showed that there was no link between smoking and cancer!
